# Iventy

Iventy is a library that I personally use for making my own event systems in
JavaScript. I know that there are event systems already out there (node
EventEmitter, jQuery things, and a gazillion of libraries), but I like mine.
It tackles issues around problems that I am tackling and allows me to proceed
with issues in a rapid developmnent style.
