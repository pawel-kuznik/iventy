# Iventy

Iventy is a library that I personally use for making my own event systems in
JavaScript. I know that there are event systems already out there (node
EventEmitter, jQuery things, and a gazillion of libraries), but I like mine.
It even gets better, I can modify it and I don't need to make a pull request
to have it in a new release.
